## Description

This website features a random password generator that creates a random password based on the user's chosen criteria. This webpage is a useful tool for regularly making new passwords that are near-impossible to guess, which is useful for anyone who uses email, social media, or anything else that requires a password. By making this password generator, I learned how to work in javascript on a much deeper level than I ever knew before.
